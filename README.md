Advanced Card War Game: OOP Implementation
Architected a Java Card War Game demonstrating mastery of OOP: Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. 
Developed a custom event-driven Swing/AWT GUI featuring complex win-logic and randomized deck management. 
Prioritizes modularity and clean code standards, incorporating Java Sound API for a polished UX.

Key Features:
Custom "Kotchena" UI: A casino-themed interface built with Java Swing and AWT for a native, lightweight experience.
Shape Collection Mechanic: Unlike standard War, this version introduces a strategic win condition where players must collect all four suits (♥, ♦, ♣, ♠).
Dynamic UX: Real-time round updates, interactive buttons, and immersive sound effects using the Java Sound API.
Game Lifecycle Management: Full replayability logic allowing users to restart or exit seamlessly post-match.

Technical OOP Architecture
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:
Encapsulation:	Used private fields in Player, Card, and Deck with public accessors to ensure data integrity and security.
Abstraction:	Implemented the Displayable interface to separate UI logic from core game data.
Inheritance:	Extended JFrame for the main GUI and utilized the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) hierarchy.
Polymorphism:	Leveraged the Comparable interface for custom card value comparisons and dynamic UI component updates.
